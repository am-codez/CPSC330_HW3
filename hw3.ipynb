    "Typically, data isn't readily formatted for direct input into machine learning models. It's crucial for a machine learning practitioner to examine each column and determine an effective method for encoding its information. Let's determine the types of features we have and come up with suitable encoding strategies for them. "

    "    - Create a pipeline object with two steps: preprocessor from 4.4 and `SVC` classifier with the `C` value.\n",
    "    - Carry out 5-fold cross validation with the pipeline.  \n",
    "    - Store the results in `results_dict` and display results as a pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "2. Which hyperparameter value seems to be performing the best? In this assignment, consider the hyperparameter value that gives you the highest cross-validation score as the \"best\" one. Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.) Is it different than the default value for the hyperparameter used by `scikit-learn`? \n",
